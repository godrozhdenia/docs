track and automatically copy trades from any solana wallet.

## how it works

1. add target wallet addresses to track
2. configure copy settings (amount, filters)
3. bot monitors target transactions in real-time
4. when target makes a trade, bot copies it to your wallet

## adding target wallets

1. tap **copytrade** from main menu
2. tap **add target**
3. paste the wallet address you want to copy
4. optionally add a label (e.g., "whale1", "alphatrader")

## configuring copy settings

### per-target settings

each target can have individual settings:

| setting | description |
|---------|-------------|
| buy amount | fixed sol amount per copy, or % of target's trade |
| min trade size | only copy trades above this threshold |
| max trade size | cap your copy size |
| auto sell | copy sells, or hold independently |
| enabled | toggle copying on/off without removing |

## monitoring targets

the copytrade menu shows:
- target wallet (shortened)
- label if set
- number of trades copied
- p&l from copies
- enabled status

tap a target to:
- view detailed stats
- edit settings
- disable/enable
- remove from tracking

## positions from copies

copied trades appear in your positions with:
- "copy" tag
- source wallet indicator
- same sell controls as regular positions

you can sell copied positions manually or let auto-sell handle it.

## handling sells

**auto sell enabled:**
- when target sells x%, you sell x%
- proportional to target's exit

**auto sell disabled:**
- target's sells are ignored
- you manage exits manually
