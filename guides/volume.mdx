title: volume bot
description: 'generate trading volume'
---


the volume bot creates trading activity on any token by executing random buys and sells across multiple wallets with randomized timing.

## how it works

the bot:
1. creates or uses existing volume wallets
2. distributes sol across wallets
3. executes random buy/sell trades at random intervals
4. continues for the configured duration
5. consolidates all funds back to your primary wallet

## starting a volume session

1. tap **volume** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. configure session parameters:
   - number of wallets
   - total sol to use
   - session duration
4. review and confirm

## session parameters

### number of wallets
more wallets = more unique addresses appearing in transaction history.

| option | effect |
|--------|--------|
| 3-5 | minimal activity, obvious patterns |
| 10-15 | moderate activity, harder to detect |
| 20+ | high activity, appears organic |

### total sol
the amount distributed across wallets for trading. this sol is recycled - each wallet buys, sells, buys again, etc.

<Info>
you don't lose the total sol amount. it's used for trading and consolidated back at the end (minus slippage and fees).
</Info>

### duration

| option | use case |
|--------|----------|
| 15 min | quick pump before announcement |
| 30 min | sustained activity for chart |
| 1 hour | extended visibility push |
| 2 hours | major campaign |
| 4 hours | full trading session |

## session management

### viewing active session
shows:
- session id
- token being traded
- wallet count
- trades executed
- volume generated (sol)
- time remaining

### stopping early
tap **stop session** to:
1. halt all trading
2. sell remaining tokens
3. consolidate sol back to primary wallet

## fund consolidation

when a session ends (completed or stopped):

1. all tokens in volume wallets are sold
2. sol is transferred back to your primary wallet
3. small amount (~0.001 sol) left in each wallet for rent

### volume economics

volume bot generates 3-4x your input in trading volume:

**example session (0.1 sol input, 30 min):**
```
input:     0.1 sol
volume:    0.39 sol (3.9x multiplier)
trades:    52 (26 buys + 26 sells)
fee:       0.003 sol (3%)
```

**cost breakdown:**

| cost | % of input | notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| platform fee | 3% | flat fee on input |
| slippage | 2-5% | per buy/sell cycle |
| gas | <1% | ~0.00001 sol per tx |

**what happens to your sol:**
1. distributed across volume wallets
2. wallets execute random buy/sell cycles
3. sol is recycled through trades (not lost)
4. at session end, tokens sold and sol consolidated
5. final return depends on token price movement

<Warning>
if token price drops during session, you may get back less than input. if it rises, you may get back more.
</Warning>

## tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="start with small amounts">
    test with 1-2 sol first to understand the flow and actual slippage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="choose liquid tokens">
    volume works best on tokens with existing liquidity. illiquid tokens have high spread.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="time your sessions">
    run during peak trading hours for maximum visibility on trackers.
