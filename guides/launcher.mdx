# token launcher

launch your own pump.fun tokens with jito bundles. dev buy + bundle wallets land in the same block as token creation.

## launch modes

### bundle only

create token + dev buy + bundle wallet buys in one atomic jito bundle.

all transactions land in **block 0** or fail together.

### bundle + snipe

same as above, plus sniper wallets that fire immediately after bundle submission.

snipers use the **same blockhash** as the bundle, targeting block 0-1 inclusion.

## how to launch

1. go to **launcher** in bot menu
2. upload token image
3. enter name, ticker, description
4. set dev buy amount (sol)
5. add bundle wallets (up to your tier limit)
6. optionally add sniper wallets
7. set jito tip (higher = more priority)
8. review and confirm

## technical details

### bundle flow

1. upload metadata to ipfs (pinata)
2. get fresh blockhash from helius
3. build create_v2 + extend_account + dev buy tx
4. build bundle wallet buy txs
5. submit all as jito bundle
6. bundle lands in block 0 or fails

### sniper flow

1. build sniper txs with same blockhash as bundle
2. submit bundle to jito
3. immediately fire all sniper txs via helius sender
4. snipers race to land in block 0-1

### why block 0 matters

- no front-running possible
- all buys at lowest price
- appears as organic launch
- snipers get in before public
