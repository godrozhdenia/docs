---

launch your own pump.fun tokens with jito bundles. dev buy + bundle wallets + swarm all land in the same block.

## launch modes

### bundle only

create token + dev buy + bundle wallet buys in one atomic jito bundle. all transactions land in **block 0** or fail together.

### bundle + snipe

bundle + sniper wallets that fire immediately after submission. snipers use **same blockhash**, targeting block 0-1.

### bundle + swarm

bundle + swarm wallets for maximum holder count. swarm wallets execute coordinated buys across many wallets in the same block as your launch.

## how to launch

1. go to **launcher** in bot menu
2. upload token image
3. enter name, ticker, description
4. set dev buy amount (sol)
5. add bundle wallets (block 0)
6. add swarm wallets (block 0, max holders)
7. add sniper wallets (block 0-1)
8. set jito tip (higher = more priority)
8. review and confirm

## bundle wallets

## technical details

### bundle flow

1. upload metadata to ipfs (pinata)
2. get fresh blockhash from helius grpc (laserstream)
3. build create_v2 + extend_account + dev buy tx
4. build bundle wallet buy txs
5. submit all as jito bundle
6. bundle lands in block 0 or fails

### sniper flow

1. build sniper txs with same blockhash as bundle
2. submit bundle to jito block engine
3. immediately fire all sniper txs via helius sender (staked validators)
4. snipers race to land in block 0-1

### creator fee collection

pump.fun tokens generate creator fees on every trade. the bot automatically:
1. tracks all tokens you've launched
2. monitors accumulated fees
3. one-click claim to your wallet

### why block 0 matters

- no front-running possible
- all buys at lowest price
- appears as organic launch
- snipers get in before public
- creator fees start accumulating immediately
