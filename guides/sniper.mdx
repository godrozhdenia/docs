```

example: `/snipe ABC123...pump`

## sniper modes

### manual snipe
enter a token address and execute immediately. useful when you spot a token that just launched.

### watchlist snipe
add tickers or contract addresses to a watchlist. when matching tokens launch, the bot automatically buys.

### auto snipe (bronze+ tier)
automatically snipes tokens matching your configured filters without manual intervention.

## setting up

1. tap **snipe** from main menu
2. configure your settings
3. add to watchlist or wait for launches

## sniper settings

### buy amount
how much sol to spend per snipe:
- 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 sol
- or custom amount

### slippage
recommended: 30-50% for new launches (high volatility expected)

### stop loss / take profit
automatically sell when price moves:
- **stop loss**: sell if price drops x%
- **take profit**: sell if price rises x%

set both to manage risk automatically.

## watchlist management

### adding to watchlist

**by ticker:**
type the ticker like `PEPE` and it will match any token with that in the name.

**by contract address:**
paste the full contract address for exact matching.

### removing from watchlist
1. go to **snipe** > **watchlist**
2. tap the item to remove
3. confirm removal

## position management

after a successful snipe, the position appears in your sniper positions.

### viewing positions
- token name and symbol
- entry price
- current price
- p&l percentage
- sl/tp levels

### quick sell
from positions menu:
- 25% - take partial profits
- 50% - half position
- 75% - leave runners
- 100% - close entirely

### close all
sells all sniper positions at once.

## auto sl/tp execution

when you set stop loss or take profit:

1. monitor checks prices regularly
2. if trigger price is hit, sell executes automatically
3. position updates to "stopped_out" or "took_profit"

<Info>
sl/tp execution uses jupiter for best routing. actual exit price may differ slightly from trigger due to slippage.

## tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="set realistic sl/tp">
    new tokens are volatile. 50% sl and 200% tp are common starting points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="don't oversize">
    most snipes are high risk. keep position sizes small relative to portfolio.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="research beforehand">
    if you're adding to watchlist, research the project first. not every launch is worth sniping.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="monitor actively">
    even with auto sl/tp, check positions regularly. liquidity can disappear faster than price updates.
