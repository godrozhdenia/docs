description: 'multi-wallet coordinated buys'
---


swarm mode executes buys across multiple wallets simultaneously.

## how it works

instead of one large buy from one wallet, swarm splits your purchase across multiple wallets.

each wallet executes independently, making the buys appear as separate transactions.

## starting a swarm buy

### quick command (fastest)

```
/swarm <token_address> <sol_per_wallet> <wallet_count>
```

example: `/swarm ABC123...pump 0.01 5`

shows confirmation then executes.

### via menu

1. tap **buy** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. select number of wallets (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, or custom)
4. set amount per wallet
5. review total cost and fees
6. confirm to execute

## wallet requirements

you need enough wallets created before starting a swarm. if you select 10 wallets but only have 5, the bot will create additional wallets automatically.

each wallet needs to be funded with:
- buy amount
- platform fee share
- gas for transaction (~0.002 sol)

## managing swarm positions

after a swarm buy, tokens are distributed across wallets.

### viewing positions

go to **positions** to see:
- total tokens held across all wallets
- average entry price
- current value
- profit/loss percentage

### selling swarm positions

two options:

**1. sell all**
- sells tokens from all wallets
- one coordinated exit

**2. consolidate & sell**
- moves all tokens to primary wallet
- sells from single wallet

## consolidation

after trading, tokens and sol can be consolidated:

1. go to **positions**
2. tap **consolidate all**
3. sol transfers back to your primary wallet

small amount (~0.001 sol) left in each wallet for rent.

## handling failures

if some wallet buys fail:

1. go to **positions**
2. tap **retry failed**
3. failed wallets will attempt to buy again

common failure reasons:
- insufficient sol (gas)
- slippage exceeded
- token liquidity dried up
