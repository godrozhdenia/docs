title: volume bot
description: 'generate trading volume'
---


generate trading activity on any token with randomized buy/sell cycles.

## how it works

1. creates or uses existing volume wallets
2. distributes sol across wallets
3. executes random buy/sell trades at random intervals
4. continues for configured duration
5. consolidates all funds back to your primary wallet

## starting a session

1. tap **volume** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. configure:
   - number of wallets
   - total sol to use
   - session duration
4. review and confirm

## settings

### number of wallets
more wallets = more unique addresses in transaction history.

| option | effect |
|--------|--------|
| 3-5 | minimal activity |
| 10-15 | moderate activity |
| 20+ | high activity, appears more organic |

### total sol
the amount distributed across wallets for trading. this sol is recycled - each wallet buys, sells, buys again, etc.

you don't lose the total sol amount. it's used for trading and consolidated back at the end (minus slippage and fees).

### duration

| option | use case |
|--------|----------|
| 15 min | quick push |
| 30 min | sustained activity |
| 1 hour | extended visibility |
| 2 hours | major campaign |
| 4 hours | full trading session |

## managing sessions

### viewing active session
shows:
- session id
- token being traded
- wallet count
- trades executed
- volume generated
- time remaining

### stopping early
tap **stop session** to:
1. halt all trading
2. sell remaining tokens
3. consolidate sol back to primary wallet

## consolidation

when a session ends (completed or stopped):
1. all tokens in volume wallets are sold
2. sol is transferred back to your primary wallet
3. small amount left in each wallet for rent

### volume multiplier

the volume generated is typically 3-4x your input sol:

| input | volume generated | trades |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 0.1 sol | ~0.4 sol | ~50 |
| 1 sol | ~4 sol | ~100 |
| 10 sol | ~40 sol | ~200 |

### costs breakdown

| cost type | amount |
|-----------|--------|
| platform fee | 3% of input |
| slippage | ~2-5% per trade cycle |
| gas | ~0.00001 sol per tx |

most of your input sol is recycled through buy/sell cycles. final consolidation returns depend on token price movement during the session.

## limits by tier

| tier | max wallets |
|------|-------------|
| free | 3 |
| bronze | 10 |
| silver | 25 |
| gold | 50 |
| diamond | 500 |
