# volume bot

generate trading activity on any token with randomized buy/sell cycles.

## how it works

1. creates or uses existing volume wallets
2. distributes sol across wallets
3. executes random buy/sell trades at random intervals
4. continues for configured duration
5. consolidates all funds back to your primary wallet

## starting a session

1. tap **volume** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. configure:
   - number of wallets
   - total sol to use
   - session duration
4. review and confirm

## settings

### number of wallets
more wallets = more unique addresses in transaction history.

| option | effect |
|--------|--------|
| 3-5 | minimal activity |
| 10-15 | moderate activity |
| 20+ | high activity, appears more organic |

### total sol
the amount distributed across wallets for trading. this sol is recycled - each wallet buys, sells, buys again, etc.

you don't lose the total sol amount. it's used for trading and consolidated back at the end (minus slippage and fees).

### duration

| option | use case |
|--------|----------|
| 15 min | quick push |
| 30 min | sustained activity |
| 1 hour | extended visibility |
| 2 hours | major campaign |
| 4 hours | full trading session |

## managing sessions

### viewing active session
shows:
- session id
- token being traded
- wallet count
- trades executed
- volume generated
- time remaining

### stopping early
tap **stop session** to:
1. halt all trading
2. sell remaining tokens
3. consolidate sol back to primary wallet

## consolidation

when a session ends (completed or stopped):
1. all tokens in volume wallets are sold
2. sol is transferred back to your primary wallet
3. small amount left in each wallet for rent

### expected returns

| input | typical return |
|-------|---------------|
| 10 sol | 9.5-9.8 sol |
| 50 sol | 48-49 sol |
| 100 sol | 96-98 sol |

losses are from trading slippage, token spread, platform fees, and gas.

## limits by tier

| tier | max wallets | max duration |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| free | 5 | 15 min |
| bronze | 15 | 1 hour |
| silver | 25 | 2 hours |
| gold | 50 | 4 hours |
| diamond | 100 | 8 hours |
