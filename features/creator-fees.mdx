# creator fee collection

automatically track and claim pump.fun creator fees from all tokens you've launched.

## how it works

pump.fun tokens generate creator fees on every trade. as the token creator, you earn a percentage of all trading volume.

the bot:
1. tracks all tokens you've launched
2. monitors accumulated fees in real-time via helius grpc
3. provides one-click claim to your wallet

## fee rates

pump.fun creator fees vary based on the token's bonding curve status:

| status | creator fee |
