monitor wallets and get notified when they trade.

## how it works

1. add a wallet address to track
2. get alerts when they buy or sell
3. one-click to follow their trades

## adding wallets

go to **wallet tracking** from main menu:

1. tap **add wallet**
2. paste the wallet address
3. optionally rename it for easy identification

## managing tracked wallets

each wallet shows action buttons:

| button | action |
|--------|--------|
| **wallet** | view wallet details |
| **rename** | change the label |
| **mute/unmute** | toggle notifications |
| **delete** | remove from tracking |

## trade alerts

when a tracked wallet trades, you get a notification with:

- ticker and contract address
- token age
- market cap
- action buttons

### alert actions

| button | action |
|--------|--------|
| **buy** | start a swarm buy for this token |
| **sell** | sell all your holdings of this token |
| **vamp** | collect to master + sell (100% slippage) |

## limits by tier

| tier | tracked wallets |
|------|-----------------|
| free | 5 |
| bronze | 10 |
| silver | 25 |
| gold | 50 |
| diamond | 100 |

## tips

- mute wallets during high activity periods
- rename wallets to remember who they are
- use vamp for quick exits on tracked trades
