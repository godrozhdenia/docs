# token sniper

automatically buy new token launches within milliseconds.

## how it works

1. add tickers or contract addresses to your watchlist
2. set your buy amount and slippage
3. when a matching token launches, the bot buys automatically

## sniper modes

### manual snipe
enter a token address and buy immediately. for tokens that just launched.

### watchlist snipe
add tickers or addresses to watch. when matching tokens launch, auto-buy triggers.

### auto snipe (bronze+ tier)
snipe any new token matching your filters without manual setup.

## settings

### buy amount
how much sol to spend per snipe:
- 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 sol
- or custom amount

### slippage
recommended: 30-50% for new launches (high volatility expected)

### stop loss / take profit
automatically sell when price moves:
- **stop loss**: sell if price drops x%
- **take profit**: sell if price rises x%

set both to manage risk automatically.

## watchlist

### adding items

**by ticker:**
type the ticker like `PEPE` and it will match any token with that in the name.

**by contract address:**
paste the full contract address for exact matching.

### removing items
1. go to **snipe** > **watchlist**
2. tap the item to remove
3. confirm

## positions

after a successful snipe, the position appears in your sniper positions.

### quick sell
- 25% - take partial profits
- 50% - half position
- 75% - leave runners
- 100% - close entirely
