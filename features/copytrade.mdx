description: 'automatically copy trades from other wallets'

track any solana wallet and automatically copy their trades.

## how it works

1. add target wallet addresses to track
2. configure copy settings (amount, filters)
3. when target makes a trade, the bot copies it to your wallet

## adding targets

1. tap **copytrade** from main menu
2. tap **add target**
3. paste the wallet address you want to copy
4. optionally add a label (e.g., "whale1", "alphatrader")

## settings per target

each target can have individual settings:

| setting | description |
|---------|-------------|
| buy amount | fixed sol amount per copy, or % of target's trade |
| min trade size | only copy trades above this threshold |
| max trade size | cap your copy size |
| auto sell | copy sells, or hold independently |
| enabled | toggle copying on/off without removing |

## monitoring targets

the copytrade menu shows:
- target wallet (shortened)
- label if set
- number of trades copied
- p&l from copies
- enabled status

tap a target to:
- view detailed stats
- edit settings
- disable/enable
- remove from tracking

## copy execution

when a target trades:
1. detection: target wallet transaction detected
2. filter: checks if trade matches your criteria
3. execute: places your trade
4. record: saves position for tracking

typical latency: 1-3 seconds after target's transaction confirms.

## positions

copied trades appear in your positions with:
- "copy" tag
- source wallet indicator
- same sell controls as regular positions

you can sell manually or let auto-sell handle it.

## handling sells

**auto sell enabled:**
when target sells x%, you sell x% proportionally.

**auto sell disabled:**
target's sells are ignored. you manage exits manually.

## limits by tier

| tier | max targets |
|------|-------------|
| free | 3 |
| bronze | 5 |
| silver | 10 |
| gold | 25 |
| diamond | 50 |
