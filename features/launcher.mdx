# token launcher

deploy pump.fun tokens with atomic jito bundles. all transactions land in block 0 or fail together.

## overview

the launcher uses native pump.fun instructions (not api) to create tokens with guaranteed block 0 execution. dev buy, bundle wallets, and snipers all execute atomically via jito.

## key features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="block 0 bundles">
    token create + dev buy + bundle buys in one atomic jito bundle. no front-running possible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="bundle + snipe mode">
    sniper wallets fire immediately after bundle with same blockhash. targets block 0-1.
  </Card>
  <Card title="vanity mints">
    generate custom token addresses with prefixes like "pump", "moon", etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="auto creator fees">
    automatically claim pump.fun creator fees from all launched tokens.
  </Card>

## how it works

### 1. metadata upload

your token image and metadata are uploaded to ipfs via pinata. this happens before any blockchain interaction.

### 2. bundle construction

the bot builds transactions:
- create_v2 (token creation)
- extend_account (required for pump.fun)
- dev buy (your initial purchase)
- bundle wallet buys (additional wallets)

all transactions use the same blockhash.

### 3. jito submission

the bundle is submitted to jito block engine. jito validators include all transactions atomically in block 0.

### 4. sniper firing (optional)

if bundle+snipe mode is enabled, sniper transactions fire immediately after bundle submission using the same blockhash to target block 0-1.

## technical stack

| component | purpose |
|-----------|--------|
| jito block engine | atomic block 0 bundle execution |
| helius grpc (laserstream) | real-time blockhash and account streaming |
| helius sender | ultra-low latency tx submission via staked validators |
| pinata ipfs | decentralized metadata storage |
| native pump.fun instructions | direct program calls, no api dependency |

## limits by tier
