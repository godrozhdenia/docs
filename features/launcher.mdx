# token launcher

deploy pump.fun tokens with jito bundles for guaranteed block 0 execution.

## overview

the launcher creates your token and executes all initial buys in a single atomic jito bundle. every transaction lands in the same block or fails together.

## key features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="block 0 bundles">
    token creation + all buys in one atomic bundle. no front-running possible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="bundle + snipe">
    add sniper wallets that fire with same blockhash for block 0-1 targeting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="vanity mints">
    generate custom token addresses with prefixes like "pump", "moon", etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ipfs metadata">
    automatic pinata upload. no dependency on pump.fun servers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## how it works

### 1. metadata upload

your token image and metadata are uploaded to ipfs via pinata. this happens before any blockchain interaction.

### 2. bundle construction

the bot builds transactions:
- create_v2 (token creation)
- extend_account (required for pump.fun)
- dev buy (your initial purchase)
- bundle wallet buys (additional wallets)

all transactions use the same blockhash.

### 3. jito submission

the bundle is submitted to jito block engine. jito validators include all transactions atomically in block 0.

### 4. sniper firing (optional)

if bundle+snipe mode is enabled, sniper transactions fire immediately after bundle submission using the same blockhash to target block 0-1.

## technical stack

| component | purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| jito bundle | atomic block 0 execution |
| helius sender | ultra-low latency tx submission |
| pinata ipfs | decentralized metadata storage |
| native pump.fun instructions | direct program calls, no api dependency |

## limits by tier

| tier | bundle wallets | sniper wallets | discount |
|------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| free | 5 | 2 | 0% |
| bronze | 10 | 5 | 10% |
| silver | 25 | 10 | 20% |
| gold | 50 | 25 | 35% |
| diamond | 100 | 50 | 50% |
