# swarm buy

execute buys across multiple wallets at once.

## why use swarm

instead of one large buy from one wallet, swarm splits your purchase across multiple wallets:

- distributes market impact
- each wallet executes independently
- buys appear as separate transactions

## how to use

1. tap **buy** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. select number of wallets (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, or custom)
4. set amount per wallet
5. review total cost and fees
6. confirm

## wallet setup

if you select 10 wallets but only have 5, the bot creates additional wallets automatically.

each wallet needs:
- buy amount
- platform fee share
- gas for transaction

## execution

all wallets execute their buys simultaneously. you see:
- progress as each wallet completes
- success/fail count
- transaction links

## managing positions

after a swarm buy, tokens are distributed across wallets.

### viewing
go to **positions** to see:
- total tokens held across all wallets
- average entry price
- current value
- profit/loss

### selling
two options:
1. **sell all** - sells from all wallets
2. **consolidate & sell** - moves everything to primary wallet first

## consolidation

after trading, move sol back to your primary wallet:
1. go to **positions**
2. tap **consolidate all**

this transfers sol from all wallets back to your main wallet.

## retry failed

if some wallet buys fail:
1. go to **positions**
2. tap **retry failed**
3. failed wallets will attempt to buy again
