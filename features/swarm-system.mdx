execute buys across multiple wallets at once.

## why use swarm

instead of one large buy from one wallet, swarm splits your purchase across multiple wallets:

- distributes market impact
- each wallet executes independently
- buys appear as separate transactions

## how to use

1. tap **buy** from main menu
2. enter the token contract address
3. select number of wallets (3, 5, 10, 15, 20, or custom)
4. set amount per wallet
5. review total cost and fees
6. confirm

## wallet setup

if you select 10 wallets but only have 5, the bot creates additional wallets automatically.

each wallet needs:
- buy amount
- platform fee share
- gas for transaction

## execution

all wallets execute their buys simultaneously. you see:
- progress as each wallet completes
- success/fail count
- transaction links

## managing positions

after a swarm buy, tokens are distributed across wallets.

### positions view
go to **swarm > positions** to see your holdings. each token shows:
- ticker and contract address
- number of wallets holding it
- action buttons

### per-token actions

for each position you have three options:

| action | what it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **collect** | transfer that token from all swarm wallets to master |
| **sell** | sell from all wallets holding the token |
| **vamp** | collect to master + sell from master with 100% slippage |

### vamp (recommended for exits)

vamp is the best way to exit a position:

1. collects all tokens from swarm wallets to master wallet
2. sells everything from master with 100% slippage (guaranteed execution)
3. single large sell = better price than many small sells

use **vamp** for individual tokens or **vamp all** to exit everything.

## consolidation

after trading, recover sol from swarm wallets:
1. go to **swarm > consolidate**
2. closes empty token accounts (recovers rent)
3. transfers all sol to master wallet
4. marks wallets as "used" (cleaned from ui)

## vamp all

full exit from all positions:
1. collect all tokens to master
2. sell all from master (100% slippage)
3. close all empty accounts
4. consolidate all sol to master
5. mark all swarm wallets as used

## limits by tier

| tier | max wallets | fee |
|------|-------------|-----|
| free | 20 | 2.5% |
| bronze | 25 | 2.0% |
| silver | 50 | 1.5% |
| gold | 100 | 1.0% |
| diamond | 500 | 0.75% |
