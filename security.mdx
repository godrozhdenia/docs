your private keys are stored with AES-256-GCM encryption.

## how it works

when you create a wallet:

- private key is encrypted immediately with AES-256-GCM
- encrypted keys are stored in our database
- keys are decrypted only at the moment of transaction signing
- after signing, the decrypted key is discarded from memory

## storage

- **encrypted at rest** - keys are never stored in plaintext
- **decrypted on-demand** - only when you execute a trade
- **your telegram ID** - used as part of the encryption key derivation

## best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="backup your keys">
    use the export key function in wallets to save your private keys somewhere safe. store them offline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="don't keep large amounts">
    keep only what you need for active trading. move profits to a hardware wallet or exchange.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="check before you trade">
    always verify token contract addresses before buying. we show you info but can't guarantee a token is legitimate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="never share your key">
    we will never ask for your private key. anyone who does is trying to scam you.
